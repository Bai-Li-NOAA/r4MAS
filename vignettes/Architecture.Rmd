Here we present an example of how a modular stock assessment software architecture may be implemented using `Rcpp`.

# Setup

Before running this notebook, you will need to ensure you have a C++ compiler and `Rcpp` installed. Then, try to install the `r4MAS` package from Github and load it. If you have trouble, it could be because of a problem with your C++ compiler - see the [Readme](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/r4MAS#installation-instructions) for a potential fix.

```{r}
require(Rcpp)
remotes::install_github("nmfs-fish-tools/r4MAS")

```
